# RiverGraphNet

Standalone research code for testing a gridded ML runoff generator plus graph neural network routing model.

This repository is intentionally separated from the physics model code. It contains only the LSTM/temporal-convolution runoff models, graph-routing models, data loaders, preprocessing utilities, and training loop needed to test whether the routing architecture can learn streamflow from gridded meteorological inputs and a river/terrain graph.

## What This Repo Does

The workflow is:

1. Load daily gridded meteorological forcing from yearly Zarr stores.
2. Load static gridded fields such as `landmask`, `BOTSOIL2D`, `VEG2D`, or precomputed continuous fields.
3. Load observed daily streamflow CSVs for gauge targets.
4. Generate gridded runoff with a shared LSTM or temporal convolution model.
5. Optionally transfer grid-cell runoff to routing graph nodes using a sparse source-to-target mapping.
6. Route graph-node runoff to gauges with a GNN.
7. Train with masked losses so missing streamflow observations do not contribute to loss.

## Data Expected

The example config assumes a local layout like this:

```text
data/
  aorc_daily_zarr/
    1981.zarr/
    1982.zarr/
    ...
  static/
    lon_lat.nc
    landmask.nc
    botsoil30s_res.nc
    veg30s_res.nc
  streamflow/
    26_basin_ids_ngen.txt
    daily/
      09489500.csv
      ...
  graphs/
    routing_graph_ngen_salt_verde_cache.nc
```

The graph cache should contain the directed routing graph plus graph/node metadata such as:

- `edge_index`
- `edge_weight`
- `node_features`
- `gauge_index`
- `gauge_ids`
- `runoff_source_flat_index`
- `runoff_target_index`
- `runoff_source_weight`

## Installation

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[preprocess]"
```

Install the PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric builds that match your CUDA environment before running on GPU.

## Train

```bash
python -m lstm_gnn_routing.cli.main train \
  --config-file configs/lstm_gnn_ngen_curriculum.yml
```

Or:

```bash
bash scripts/train_lstm_gnn.sh
```

## Compute Train-Period Scalers

The recommended workflow is to compute train-period scalers once, then reuse them for validation/test:

```bash
python -m lstm_gnn_routing.tools.compute_train_scaler \
  --config-file configs/lstm_gnn_ngen_curriculum.yml \
  --overwrite
```

The scaler file stores train-period statistics for normalized forcing, static inputs, and streamflow targets. Validation and test periods should load these same statistics instead of recomputing their own.

## Preprocessing Utilities

Hourly forcing can be converted to yearly Zarr stores:

```bash
python -m lstm_gnn_routing.tools.convert_hourly_forcing_to_zarr \
  --input-root /path/to/hourly/files \
  --output-root data/aorc_hourly_zarr \
  --mode yearly
```

Hourly Zarr forcing can be aggregated to daily forcing:

```bash
python -m lstm_gnn_routing.tools.aggregate_hourly_zarr_to_daily \
  --input-root data/aorc_hourly_zarr \
  --output-root data/aorc_daily_zarr
```

The daily aggregation handles precipitation as an accumulated depth and uses daily means for flux/state variables. Check the tool options before production conversion.

## Plot Ngen Network vs GNN Graph

To compare the source Ngen flowpaths with the generated routing graph:

```bash
python -m lstm_gnn_routing.tools.plot_ngen_vs_gnn_graph \
  --network-image docs/figures/NGEN_RIverNetwork.png \
  --graph data/graphs/routing_graph_ngen_salt_verde_cache.nc \
  --dem data/static/basin_srtm_dem_conditioned_on_forcing_grid.nc \
  --gauge-metadata data/streamflow/30_gauges_IN_LAMBERT.csv \
  --output docs/figures/ngen_network_vs_gnn_graph.png \
  --dem-cmap terrain \
  --dem-alpha 0.62
```

The command above uses a pre-rendered Ngen river-network panel (`docs/figures/NGEN_RIverNetwork.png`) for presentation-quality maps. The right panel is generated from the graph cache and plots the graph edges and graph nodes that the GNN actually uses during routing, with the SRTM DEM in the background.

To regenerate the left panel directly from Ngen GeoPackage flowpaths instead, replace `--network-image ...` with `--network data/ngen --outlet-gauges 09511300 09510000 09510200`.
